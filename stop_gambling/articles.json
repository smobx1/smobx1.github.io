Gambling means that you're willing to risk something you value in the hope of getting something of even greater value.</p>\n<p>Gambling can stimulate the brain's reward system much like drugs or alcohol can, leading to addiction. If you have a problem with compulsive gambling, you may continually chase bets that lead to losses, use up savings and create debt. You may hide your behavior and even turn to theft or fraud to support your addiction.</p>\n<p>Compulsive gambling is a serious condition that can destroy lives. Although treating compulsive gambling can be challenging, many people who struggle with compulsive gambling have found help through professional treatment.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-testid=\"cmp-title\">\n<h2 tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Signs and symptoms of compulsive gambling (gambling disorder) can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Being preoccupied with gambling, such as constantly planning gambling activities and how to get more gambling money</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Needing to gamble with increasing amounts of money to get the same thrill</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trying to control, cut back or stop gambling, without success</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feeling restless or irritable when you try to cut down on gambling</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gambling to escape problems or relieve feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety or depression</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trying to get back lost money by gambling more (chasing losses)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lying to family members or others to hide the extent of your gambling</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Risking or losing important relationships, a job, or school or work opportunities because of gambling</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Asking others to bail you out of financial trouble because you gambled money away</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most casual gamblers stop when losing or set a limit on how much they're willing to lose. But people with a compulsive gambling problem are compelled to keep playing to recover their money &mdash; a pattern that becomes increasingly destructive over time. Some people may turn to theft or fraud to get gambling money.</p>\n<p>Some people with a compulsive gambling problem may have periods of remission &mdash; a length of time where they gamble less or not at all. But without treatment, the remission usually isn't permanent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>When to see a doctor or mental health professional</h3>\n<p>Have family members, friends or co-workers expressed concern about your gambling? If so, listen to their worries. Because denial is almost always a feature of compulsive or addictive behavior, it may be difficult for you to realize that you have a problem.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-testid=\"cmp-title\">\n<h2 tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Causes</strong></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Exactly what causes someone to gamble compulsively isn't well understood. Like many problems, compulsive gambling may result from a combination of biological, genetic and environmental factors.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-testid=\"cmp-title\">\n<h2 tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Although most people who play cards or wager never develop a gambling problem, certain factors are more often associated with compulsive gambling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Mental health issues.</strong></strong> People who gamble compulsively often have substance misuse problems, personality disorders, depression or anxiety. Compulsive gambling may also be associated with bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Age.</strong></strong> Compulsive gambling is more common in younger and middle-aged people. Gambling during childhood or the teenage years increases the risk of developing compulsive gambling. But compulsive gambling in the older adult population can also be a problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Sex.</strong></strong> Compulsive gambling is more common in men than women. Women who gamble typically start later in life and may become addicted more quickly. But gambling patterns among men and women have become increasingly similar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Family or friend influence.</strong></strong> If your family members or friends have a gambling problem, the chances are greater that you will, too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Medications used to treat Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome.</strong></strong> Drugs called dopamine agonists have a rare side effect that may result in compulsive behaviors, including gambling, in some people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Certain personality characteristics.</strong></strong> Being highly competitive, a workaholic, impulsive, restless or easily bored may increase your risk of compulsive gambling.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<section data-testid=\"cmp-section\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-testid=\"cmp-title\">\n<h2 tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Complications</strong></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Compulsive gambling can have profound and long-lasting consequences for your life, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Relationship problems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Financial problems, including bankruptcy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal problems or imprisonment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Poor work performance or job loss</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Poor general health</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Suicide, suicide attempts or suicidal thoughts</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-testid=\"cmp-title\">\n<h2 tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Although there's no proven way to prevent a gambling problem, educational programs that target individuals and groups at increased risk may be helpful.</p>\n<p>If you have risk factors for compulsive gambling, consider avoiding gambling in any form, people who gamble and places where gambling occurs. Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent gambling from becoming worse.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<section data-testid=\"cmp-section\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-testid=\"cmp-title\"><hr />\n<h2 tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If you recognize that you may have a problem with gambling, talk with your health care provider about an evaluation or seek help from a mental health professional.</p>\n<p>To evaluate your problem with gambling, your health care provider or mental health provider will likely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Ask questions related to your gambling habits.</strong></strong> Your provider may also ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Review your medical information.</strong></strong> Some drugs can have a rare side effect that results in compulsive behaviors, including gambling, in some people. A physical exam may identify problems with your health that are sometimes associated with compulsive gambling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Do a mental health assessment.</strong></strong> This assessment includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns related to your gambling. Depending on your signs and symptoms, you may be evaluated for mental health disorders that are sometimes related to excessive gambling.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section data-testid=\"cmp-section\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-testid=\"cmp-title\">\n<h2 tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Treating compulsive gambling can be challenging. That's partly because most people have a hard time admitting they have a problem. Yet a major part of treatment is working on acknowledging that you're a compulsive gambler.</p>\n<p>If your family or your employer pressured you into therapy, you may find yourself resisting treatment. But treating a gambling problem can help you regain a sense of control &mdash; and possibly help heal damaged relationships or finances.</p>\n<p>Treatment for compulsive gambling may include these approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Therapy.</strong></strong> Behavioral therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful. Behavioral therapy uses a process of exposure to the behavior you want to unlearn and teaches you skills to reduce your urge to gamble. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on identifying unhealthy, irrational and negative beliefs and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. Family therapy also may be helpful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Medications.</strong></strong> Antidepressants and mood stabilizers may help treat problems that often go along with compulsive gambling &mdash; such as bipolar disorder, depression or anxiety. Some antidepressants may be effective in reducing gambling behavior. Medications called narcotic antagonists, useful in treating substance misuse, may help treat compulsive gambling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Self-help groups.</strong></strong> Some people find that talking with others who have a gambling problem may be a helpful part of treatment. Ask your health care provider or mental health provider for advice on self-help groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous and other resources.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment for compulsive gambling may involve an outpatient program, inpatient program or a residential treatment program, depending on your needs and resources. Self-help treatments such as structured internet-based programs and telephone visits with a mental health professional may be an option for some people.</p>\n<p>Treatment for substance misuse, depression, anxiety or any other mental health issue may be part of your treatment plan for compulsive gambling.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3><strong>Relapse prevention</strong></h3>\n<p>Even with treatment, you may return to gambling, especially if you spend time with people who gamble or you're in gambling settings. If you feel that you'll start gambling again, contact your mental health provider or sponsor right away to prevent a relapse.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n<section data-testid=\"cmp-section\">\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

People in this group lose control of their betting to the point that it negatively impacts their life.</p>\n<p>Pathological (harmful) gambling can be a form of <a href=\"https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/what-is-addiction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>addiction</u></a>. People with a gambling addiction can't control their urge to gamble, even if they are losing a lot of money.

    "body": "<h1>How gambling affects the brain and who is most vulnerable to addiction</h1>\n<div>\n<p>Once confined mostly to casinos concentrated in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, access to gambling has expanded dramatically, including among children.</p>\n<p>It has never been easier to place a bet. Once confined mostly to casinos concentrated in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, gambling has expanded to include ready access to lotteries and online games and video games with gambling elements for adults and children.</p>\n<p>Sports betting is now legal in 37 states plus Washington, DC, with six more considering legislation, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>according to American Gaming Association data from early 2023.</u></a> People can gamble around the clock from anywhere and, increasingly, at many ages, including teenagers and even young children who are well below the legal age for gambling.</p>\n<p>As access to gambling has expanded, psychologists and other experts have become concerned not just that more people will give it a try, but that more will develop gambling problems. And while it is still too soon to know what the long-term effects will be, evidence is growing to suggest that young people, especially boys and men, are among those particularly vulnerable to gambling addiction&mdash;the same demographic most often participating in the newest forms of gambling: sports betting and video game-based gambling.</p>\n<p>People in their early 20s are the fastest-growing group of gamblers, according to recent research. And many kids are starting younger than that. Nearly two-thirds of adolescents, ages 12 to 18, said they had gambled or played gambling-like games in the previous year, according to a 2018 Canadian survey of more than 38,000 youth funded by the government of British Columbia (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em><em><u>Understanding the Odds</u></em></em><u>, McCreary Centre Society, 2021 [PDF, 1.1MB]</u></a>). Starting young carries a relatively high burden of psychological distress and increased chances of developing problems.</p>\n<p>Researchers are now working to refine their understanding of the psychological principles that underlie the drive to gamble and the neurological underpinnings of what happens in the brains of gamblers who struggle to stop. Counter to simplistic assumptions about the role that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays in addictions (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>Nutt, D. J., et al., </u><em><em><u>Nature Reviews Neuroscience</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 16, No. 5, 2015</u></a>), research is showing variations in the volume and activity of certain areas of the brain related to learning, stress management, and rewards processing that might contribute to problematic gambling.</p>\n<p>Understanding what makes certain people vulnerable to developing problems could ultimately lead to better strategies for prevention and treatment, and also elucidate the evolving health impacts of gambling, the consequences of starting young, and even the role that the government should play in addressing those issues.</p>\n<p>As it stands, the National Institutes of Health has agencies dedicated to problem alcohol use and drug use, but there are no official efforts aimed at problem gambling, and there are no federal regulations against advertisements for sports betting, said social worker Lia Nower, JD, PhD, director of the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey. That means kids can see ads, often featuring their sports heroes promoting gambling, at any time of day or night. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wild, wild west with regard to gambling,&rdquo; Nower said.</p>\n<h2>Examining the risks</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most adults and adolescents in the United States have placed some type of bet, and most do it without problems. But a significant subset of people who start gambling go on to develop gambling disorder, defined in the <em><em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em></em> (Fifth Edition) as a persistent, recurrent pattern of gambling that is associated with substantial distress or impairment.</p>\n<p>Gambling problems, previously called pathological gambling, were considered an impulse control disorder until 2013, when the <em><em>DSM-5</em></em> classified them as an addictive disorder. That made gambling addiction the first, and so far the only, defined behavioral addiction in the clinical section of <em><em>DSM-5</em></em> (with some hints that video gaming disorder might ultimately follow, experts say). Like addictions to alcohol and drugs, gambling addictions are characterized by an increasing tolerance that requires more gambling as time goes on to feel satisfied. People with the disorder can also experience withdrawal that causes irritability when they try to quit.</p>\n<p>Over the last 20 years or so, researchers have refined their understanding of how common gambling addictions are and who is most vulnerable. Among adults, the estimated proportion of people with a problem ranges from 0.4% to 2%, depending on the study and country. Rates rise for people with other addictions and conditions. About 4% of people being treated for substance use also have gambling disorder, as do nearly 7% of psychiatric inpatients and up to 7% of people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. An estimated 96% of people with gambling problems have at least one other psychiatric disorder. Substance use disorders, impulse-control disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders are particularly common among people with gambling problems (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>Potenza, M. N., et al., </u><em><em><u>Nature Reviews Disease Primers</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 5, No. 51, 2019</u></a>).</p>\n<p>Vulnerability is high in people with low incomes who have more to gain with a big win, added psychologist Shane Kraus, PhD, director of the Behavioral Addictions Lab at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Young people, especially boys and men, are another susceptible group. Up to 5% of adolescents and young adults who gamble develop a disorder. And men outnumber women at a ratio of about 2 to 1 among people with gambling addictions, although there are a growing number of women with the disorder.</p>\n<p>Despite concerns, scientists have yet to document a consistent rise in the rates of gambling problems in recent years, said Jeffrey Derevensky, PhD, a psychologist and director of the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviours at McGill University. Still, because more people now have access to gambling, evidence suggests that overall numbers of problems appear to have risen, Derevensky said. After Ohio legalized sports betting, for example, the number of daily calls to the state&rsquo;s gambling helpline rose from 20 to 48, according to the Ohio Casino Control Commission. Other states have reported similar trends.</p>\n<p>As evidence accumulates, it is important to examine the risks without overreacting before the data are in, said Marc Potenza, PhD, MD, director of Yale University&rsquo;s Center of Excellence in Gambling Research. When casinos enter a region, he said, the area may experience a transient bump in gambling problems followed by a return to normal. Given how quickly gambling is evolving with digital technologies, only time will tell what their impact will be. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be overly sensationalistic, but we do wish to be proactive in understanding and addressing possible consequences of legalized gambling expansion,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<h2>From gaming to gambling</h2>\n<div>\n<p>After years of studying the psychological effects of video game violence, psychologist James Sauer, PhD, a senior lecturer at the University of Tasmania in Australia, took notice when Belgium became the first country to ban a feature called loot boxes in video games in 2018. Loot boxes are digital containers that players can buy for a small amount of money. Once purchased, the box might reveal a special skin or weapon that enhances a character&rsquo;s looks or gives a player a competitive advantage. Or it might be worthless.</p>\n<p>On a Skype call after the news broke, Sauer, a psychological scientist and coexecutive director of the International Media Psychology Laboratory, talked with his collaborator, psychological scientist Aaron Drummond, PhD, of Massey University in New Zealand, about Belgium&rsquo;s decision. Because loot boxes represent a financial risk with an unknown reward, Belgian policymakers had categorized them as a form of gambling, and those policymakers were not the only ones. Countries and states that have passed or considered regulations on loot boxes include Australia, the Netherlands, and Hawaii. But those regulations were contentious.</p>\n<p>Sauer and Drummond discussed the need for more science to guide the debate. &ldquo;We were trying to think about how we might contribute something sensible to a discussion about whether these in-game reward mechanisms should or should not be viewed as a form of gambling,&rdquo; Sauer said.</p>\n<p>To fill the evidence gap, the researchers watched online videos of players opening loot boxes in 22 popular and recently released games that had been rated by the Entertainment Software Ratings Board as appropriate for people ages 17 and younger. Nearly half of the games met the definition for gambling, the researchers reported in 2018, including <em><em>Madden NFL 18</em></em>, <em><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Origins</em></em>, <em><em>FIFA 18</em></em>, and <em><em>Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</em></em> (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em><em><u>Nature Human Behaviour</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 2, 2018</u></a>). Among the criteria for qualifying as gambling was an exchange of real money for valuable goods with an unknown outcome determined at least partly by chance. Purchased objects had value that gave an advantage in the game and sometimes could be sold or traded to others for real money.</p>\n<p>Loot boxes tap into the same psychological principles that draw people to slot machines, Sauer said. They may deliver a big payoff, but payoffs come at random intervals. Unlike rewards given after every repetition of a behavior, this type of variable ratio reinforcement, or intermittent reinforcement, exploits a cognitive distortion that makes a player or gambler view each loss as one step closer to a win and can lead to very rapid adoption of a behavior that can then be hard to extinguish, Sauer said. Animals exhibit the same patterns. &ldquo;They feel sure that the reward is coming, but they can&rsquo;t know when, so they keep repeating the behavior,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They continue even as rewards become less and less frequent and even stop entirely.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After establishing that loot boxes, which generate billions of dollars in revenue for video game companies, are often in fact a type of gambling, studies by Sauer&rsquo;s group and others since then have shown that people who spend more on loot boxes are often at higher risk of developing gambling problems, and that the connection is strongest in adolescence. Scientists are now working to untangle the question of whether buying loot boxes can cause gambling addictions, and at least some evidence supports this kind of gateway idea.</p>\n<p>In one survey of 1,102 adults in the United Kingdom, about 20% of gamblers said that loot boxes were their first introduction to gambling and that their experiences with the game rewards made them think that other forms of gambling could be fun, according to a 2022 study (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>Spicer, S. G., et al., </u><em><em><u>Addictive Behaviors</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 131, No. 107327, 2022</u></a>). More than 80% of them had started buying loot boxes before they were 18. More recently, Canadian researchers surveyed hundreds of young adult video gamers at two time points, 6 months apart. Among those who were not gamblers when the study started, dozens went on to gamble over the course of the study, they reported in 2023, suggesting that loot boxes had opened the gambling floodgates (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>Brooks, G. A., &amp; Clark, L., </u><em><em><u>Computers in Human Behavior</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 141, No. 107605, 2023</u></a>).</p>\n<p>But the relationship can also go the other way. People who already gambled, the Canadian researchers found, spent more on loot boxes. And in the U.K. research, about 20% of people who started out with other types of gambling migrated to loot boxes&mdash;the same proportion that went in the other direction. Figuring out how loot boxes and gambling behavior influence each other remains a work in progress. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t have the data yet to understand the long-term consequences,&rdquo; Sauer said.</p>\n<p>Also contentious is the question of how loot boxes affect mental health. Sauer&rsquo;s group has found a link between spending on loot boxes and severe psychological distress (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em><em><u>Scientific Reports</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 12, No. 16128, 2022</u></a>), while other research has failed to find the same association. Because kids are increasingly being exposed to gambling, it is an important question to sort through. &ldquo;Some researchers have argued,&rdquo; Sauer said, &ldquo;that if we don&rsquo;t want kids engaging with bona fide gambling behaviors, maybe we want to be wary about kids engaging with these...gambling-like reward mechanisms.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Early exposure</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Loot boxes are not the only avenue to gambling for kids. Online games that simulate gambling without financial risk are often available to very young children, said Derevensky, who once watched a young girl play a slot machine game on a tablet installed in an airport waiting area. She was earning points, not real money, and loving it. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s winning, and she&rsquo;s saying to her dad, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until I play it for real,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She must&rsquo;ve been no more than 6 years old.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By adolescence, about 40% of people have played simulated gambling games, studies show. These games often involve more winning than their real-world equivalents, Derevensky said. And that playful introduction without financial stakes can spark an interest. Work by his group and others has shown that teens who play simulated gambling games for points are at higher risk of having gambling problems later on (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>Hing, N., et al., </u><em><em><u>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 19, No. 17, 2022</u></a>).</p>\n<p>Seeing parents, siblings, or other members of the household gamble also normalizes gambling for kids, making them more likely to engage in gambling and other risky behaviors, including alcohol and drug use, Nower has found in her research (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em><em><u>Addictive Behaviors</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 135, No. 107460, 2022</u></a>). And the earlier kids get exposed to gambling through online games and other avenues, studies suggest, the more severe their gambling problems are likely to be later on (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>Rahman, A. S., et al., </u><em><em><u>Journal of Psychiatric Research</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 46, No. 5, 2012</u></a>).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kids as young as preschool are being bombarded with requests to buy things in video games,&rdquo; Nower said. &ldquo;A lot of kids move from betting on loot boxes in video games to playing social casino games that are free and then triage them to pay sites. You can&rsquo;t really tell gambling from video gaming anymore. There&rsquo;s so much overlap.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>The brain of a problem gambler</h2>\n<div>\n<p>To understand why early exposure makes a difference, and why a subset of people develop gambling addictions, some scientists have been looking to the brain.</p>\n<p>Studies have linked gambling disorders to variations in a variety of brain regions, particularly the striatum and prefrontal cortex, which are involved in reward processing, social and emotional problems, stress, and more. Some of these differences may be attributable to genetics. Twin studies and modeling work suggest that genes explain half or more of individual differences with gambling problems, specifically.</p>\n<p>In people with gambling disorders as well as substance use disorders, a meta-analysis found that several studies showed less activity in the ventral striatum while anticipating monetary rewards (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>Luijten, M., et al., </u><em><em><u>JAMA Psychiatry</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 74, No. 4, 2017</u></a>). Along with other findings, those results suggest that this part of the brain contributes to impulsive behaviors for people with gambling problems.</p>\n<p>Among other emerging insights, people with gambling problems also have smaller volumes in their amygdala and hippocampus, two regions related to emotional learning and stress regulation. Brain research might help explain why teenagers are particularly susceptible to gambling, Potenza said, including the observation that different parts of the brain mature at different rates in ways that predispose teenagers to gambling and other risk-taking behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, which regulates impulsivity and decision-making, is particularly late to develop, especially in boys.</p>\n<p>Parsing out the details could lead to new treatments, Potenza said. For example, he and colleagues stimulated the prefrontal cortex of people with problematic gaming behavior and found improvements in their ability to regulate cravings and emotions (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em><em><u>European Neuropsychopharmacology</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 36, 2020</u></a>). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun approving neuromodulatory approaches for using targeted brain stimulation to treat psychiatric conditions, including addictions, that could eventually help people with gambling problems, Potenza said.</p>\n<p>New strategies for treatment would be welcome, experts say, as gambling is a particularly tricky addiction to treat, in part because it is easy to hide. As many as 90% or more of people with gambling problems never seek help (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>Bijker, R., et al., </u><em><em><u>Addiction</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 117, No. 12, 2022</u></a>).</p>\n<p>For now, cognitive behavioral therapy is the most common form of treatment for gambling addiction, Nower said, and identifying pathways can tailor therapy to particular needs. She has proposed three main pathways that can lead to gambling problems (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em><em><u>Addiction</u></em></em><u>, Vol. 117, No. 7, 2022</u></a>). For one group of people, habitual gambling pushes them to chase wins until they develop a problem. A second group comes from a history of trauma, abuse, or neglect, and gambling offers an escape from stress, depression, and anxiety. A third group may have antisocial or impulsive personalities with risk-taking behaviors.</p>\n<h2>Betting on the game</h2>\n<div>\n<p>For young adults who have grown up with video games and online gambling games, sports betting is the newest frontier&mdash;for both gamblers and researchers interested in understanding the consequences of early exposure to gambling.</p>\n<p>Now legal in many states, the activity has exploded in popularity. An estimated 50 million people were expected to bet some $16 billion on the Super Bowl this year, according to the American Gaming Association, more than double the amount wagered the year before. (Official numbers are not yet available and are usually an underestimate because of &ldquo;off the books&rdquo; betting, Nower said.) At its peak, according to news reports, the betting platform FanDuel reported taking 50,000 bets per minute. Billions more were expected to be bet on March Madness.</p>\n<p>Sports bettors trend young: The fastest-growing group of sports gamblers are between 21 and 24 years old, according to an analysis by Nower&rsquo;s group of data from New Jersey, which legalized sports gambling in 2018. Compared with other kinds of gambling, the in-game betting offered during sports games is highly dependent on impulsivity, Nower said. There are opportunities to place bets during the game on everything from who will win the coin toss to which quarterback will throw 100 yards first to how long the national anthem will last. And impulsivity is particularly common in younger people and among sports fans caught up in the emotion of a game, Nower said.</p>\n<p>Researchers are still collecting data to see if sports betting is causing a true surge in gambling problems, said Kraus, who is working on a longitudinal study of sports bettors that is following about 4,000 people over a year to see who is most likely to go from betting on a game to having problems with gambling. His group just collected their third wave of data and will be writing up a paper on their results in the coming months. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be riding on this issue for years,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Early signs from Nower&rsquo;s research in New Jersey suggest that people who engage in sports betting appear to develop gambling problems at particularly high rates and are at higher risk for mental health and substance use problems compared with other kinds of gamblers. About 14% of sports bettors reported thoughts of suicide and 10% said they had made a suicide attempt, she and colleagues found in one New Jersey study.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Risk-takers who like action can get really involved in sports wagering,&rdquo; Nower said. &ldquo;Because of gambling on mobile phones and tablets, there&rsquo;s no real way to keep children from gambling on their parents&rsquo;, friends&rsquo;, or siblings&rsquo; accounts. And they&rsquo;re being bombarded with all these advertisements. This is a recipe for problems among a lot of young people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It takes time for a gambling problem to develop, and simple steps can interrupt the progression for many people, Kraus said. That might include placing a limit on how much they are going to spend or setting an alarm to remind them how long they have been gambling.</p>\n<p>Education before people try gambling would help, Derevensky said, and plenty of prevention programs exist, including interactive video games designed by his group. But kids do not often get access to them. Teachers are not monitoring lunch tables for gambling activity, Nower said. And administrators are not screening for problems. Derevensky recommends that parents talk with kids about loot boxes and other gambling games and explain the powerful psychological phenomena that make them appealing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We educate our kids in our school systems about alcohol use, drug use, drinking and driving, and unprotected sex,&rdquo; Derevensky said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult to find jurisdictions and school boards that have gambling prevention programs.&rdquo;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

The behavior leads to problems for the individual, families, and society. Adults and adolescents with gambling disorder have trouble controlling their gambling. They will continue even when it causes significant problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>A diagnosis of gambling disorder requires at least four of the following during the past year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Need to gamble with increasing amounts to achieve the desired excitement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restless or irritable when trying to cut down or stop gambling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back on or stop gambling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Frequent thoughts about gambling (such as reliving past gambling or planning future gambling).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Often gambling when feeling distressed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After losing money gambling, often returning to get even. (This is referred to as \"chasing\" one's losses.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lying to hide gambling activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Risking or losing a close relationship, a job, or a school or job opportunity because of gambling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Relying on others to help with money problems caused by gambling</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People with gambling disorder can have periods where symptoms subside. The gambling may not seem a problem in between periods of more severe symptoms.</p>\n<p>Gambling disorder tends to run in families. Factors such as trauma and social inequality, particularly in women, can be risk factors. Symptoms can begin as early as adolescence or as late as older adulthood. Men are more likely to start at a younger age. Women are more likely to start later in life.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\n<p>Some people can stop gambling on their own. But many people need help to address their gambling problems. Only one in ten people with gambling disorder seek treatment.</p>\n<p>Gambling affects people in different ways. Different approaches may work better for different people. Several types of therapy are used to treat gambling disorders, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, group therapy, and family therapy.</p>\n<p>Counseling can help people understand gambling and think about how gambling affects them and their family. It can also help people consider options and solve problems.</p>\n<p>There are no FDA-approved medications to treat gambling disorders. Some medications may help treat co-occurring conditions like depression or anxiety.</p>\n<p>Support from family and friends can be critical to a person's recovery from gambling. However, only the individual can decide to stop the behaviors.</p>\n<p><strong>Counseling can help:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gain control over your gambling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Heal family relationships.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deal with your urge to gamble.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Handle stress and other problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find other things to do with your time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Put your finances in order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintain recovery and avoid triggers.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Support groups and Self-Help</strong></p>\n<p>Support groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous, use peer support to help others stop gambling. Some research has shown physical activity can help those with gambling disorder. Many states have gambling helplines and other assistance.</p>\n<h3><strong> Strategies to deal with cravings</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reach out for support. Call a trusted friend or family member. Go to a Gamblers Anonymous meeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Distract yourself with other activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Postpone gambling. Giving yourself time may allow the urge to pass or weaken.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stop for a moment and consider what will happen when you gamble.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid isolation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Dos&rdquo; and &ldquo;don'ts&rdquo; for Partners, Friends or Family Members</strong></p>\n<p>DO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Seek the support of others with similar problems; attend a self-help group for families such as Gam-Anon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recognize your partner's good qualities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remain calm when speaking to the person with a gambling disorder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Let them know that you are seeking help for yourself; the gambling is affecting you (and possibly children).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain problem gambling to children.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Understand the need for treatment of problem gambling and that it may take time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set boundaries in managing money; take control of family finances; review bank and credit card statements.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DON'T:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Preach, lecture, or allow yourself to lose control of your anger</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exclude the gambler from family life and activities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expect immediate recovery, or that all problems will be resolved when the gambling stops</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bailout the gambler</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Preventing Suicide</strong></p>\n<p>Problem gamblers are at increased risk of suicide.

    "body": "<h2><strong>Problem Gambling</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Gambling becomes a problem when it affects a person's daily activities, mental/physical health, reputation and relationships and hurts their finances.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>Problem gambling is not just about losing money. Gambling problems can affect a person&rsquo;s whole life. Gambling is a problem when it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gets in the way of work, school or other activities</li>\n<li>harms the person&rsquo;s mental or physical health</li>\n<li>hurts the person financially</li>\n<li>damages the person&rsquo;s reputation</li>\n<li>causes problems with family or friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not all people who gamble excessively are alike, nor are the problems they face. People with gambling problems are found in all age groups, income groups, cultures and jobs. Some people develop gambling problems suddenly, others over many years.</p>\n<p>Gambling problems occur along a continuum. These are not discrete categories but possible points along a range of involvement, from not gambling at all to pathological gambling.<br /><br /><strong>No gambling:</strong> Some people never gamble.<br /><br /><strong>Casual social gambling:</strong> Most people gamble casually, buying the occasional raffle or lottery ticket or occasionally visiting a casino for entertainment.<br /><br /><strong>Serious social gambling:</strong> These people play regularly. It is their main form of entertainment, but it does not come before family and work.<br /><br /><strong>Harmful involvement:</strong> These people are experiencing difficulties in their personal, work and social relationships.<br /><br /><strong>Pathological gambling:</strong> For a small but significant number of people, gambling seriously harms all aspects of their lives. People with gambling problems this severe are unable to control the urge to gamble, despite the harm it causes. They are more likely to use gambling to escape from problems and to get relief from anxiety.</p>\n<h2><strong>Signs &amp; Symptoms</strong></h2>\n<p>Gambling problems share many similarities with other addictive disorders. However, there are no visible signs or physical changes that will indicate a gambling problem.</p>\n<p>Instead, there are common behavioural, emotional, financial and health signs.</p>\n<h5><strong>Behavioural signs of problem gambling</strong></h5>\n<p>The person:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stops doing things he or she previously enjoyed</li>\n<li>misses family events</li>\n<li>changes patterns of sleep, eating or sex</li>\n<li>ignores self-care, work, school or family tasks</li>\n<li>has conflicts with other people over money</li>\n<li>uses alcohol or other drugs more often</li>\n<li>leaves children alone, seems less concerned about who looks after them, neglects their basic care</li>\n<li>thinks about gambling all the time</li>\n<li>is less willing to spend money on things other than gambling</li>\n<li>cheats or steals to get the money to gamble or pay debts</li>\n<li>has legal problems related to gambling</li>\n<li>is often late for work or school</li>\n<li>organizes staff pools</li>\n<li>is gone for long, unexplained periods of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>Emotional signs of problem gambling</strong></h5>\n<p>The person:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>withdraws from family and friends</li>\n<li>seems far away or anxious, or has difficulty paying attention</li>\n<li>has mood swings and sudden outbursts of anger</li>\n<li>complains of boredom or restlessness</li>\n<li>seems depressed or suicidal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>Financial signs of problem gambling</strong></h5>\n<p>The person:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>frequently borrows money or asks for salary advances</li>\n<li>takes a second job without a change in finances</li>\n<li>cashes in savings accounts, RRSPs or insurance plans</li>\n<li>alternates between being broke and flashing money</li>\n<li>has family members who complain that valuables and appliances are disappearing or that money is missing from a bank account or wallet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>Health signs of problem gambling</strong></h5>\n<p>The person complains of stress-related health problems, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>stomach and bowel problems</li>\n<li>difficulty sleeping</li>\n<li>\n<p>overeating or loss of appetite.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Causes &amp; Risk Factors</strong></p>\n<p>There are many reasons why a gambling problem may develop. For example, some people develop problems when they try to win back money they have lost or because they like to be &ldquo;in the action.&rdquo; Others have many life stresses and consider gambling a welcome relief.</p>\n<p>Various risk factors can contribute to the development of gambling problems or make it more difficult to stop. People are more at risk if they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have an early big win (leading to false expectation of future wins)</li>\n<li>have easy access to their preferred form of gambling</li>\n<li>hold mistaken beliefs about the odds of winning</li>\n<li>do not take steps to monitor gambling wins and losses</li>\n<li>have had a recent loss or change, such as divorce, job loss, retirement or death of a loved one</li>\n<li>often feel bored or lonely, or have a history of risk-taking or impulsive behaviour</li>\n<li>have a history of mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety</li>\n<li>tie their self-esteem to gambling wins or losses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more factors that apply, the more likely a person is to develop a gambling problem.</p>\n<h2><strong>Diagnosis &amp; Treatment</strong></h2>\n<p>Free treatment, including counselling, is available to anyone in Ontario affected by gambling. This includes family members. Counselling can help people understand why they gamble, so they can stop, cut down or change their gambling. It can also help repair hurt feelings and regain trust with family members.</p>\n<p>In most areas, an agency that offers specialized counselling for problem gambling is available close to home. In addition, telephone counselling and a self-help guide are also available. Credit and debt counselling services, family counselling and other resources may also be helpful. The Ontario Problem Gambling Helpline can link people to the support and resources they need. It is open 24 hours a day.</p>\n<h4><strong>Counselling for the person who gambles</strong></h4>\n<p>People often ask if they will have to stop gambling to begin counselling. Only they can decide to quit gambling. A counsellor should not pressure the person to make changes before he or she is ready.</p>\n<p>Gambling affects people and their families in different ways. Problem gambling counsellors provide information about gambling. They help people look at their options, so they can decide what is right for them. This may include taking a break from gambling. Some people know right away what actions they want to take, and others aren&rsquo;t sure. Either way, taking a break from gambling can help. Then the person can think about how gambling affects him or her and how to get back in control.</p>\n<p>Counselling is a learning process. With new information, people can make good decisions. Counsellors can help them solve their main problems. This may include fixing a financial situation, healing family relations and restoring trust between the person and his or her partner.</p>\n<h4><strong>Counselling for family members</strong></h4>\n<p>When someone has a gambling problem, it can be hard for other family members to find hope for the future. Counselling can help them see that things can change. It can also help them see their family&rsquo;s strengths and the positive steps they may already be taking.</p>\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>"

    "body": "<h1><strong>Compulsive Gambling Symptoms, Causes and Effects</strong></h1>\n<p>Gambling is one of the most insidious of human vices, as it presents the illusion of easy money yet can quickly lead to financial ruin. The odds are never in your favor whether it is poker, blackjack or anything else; gambling is a successful industry because the house always wins. Read on to find out about the symptoms, causes and effects of gambling addiction.</p>\n<h2><strong>Are There Different Types of Gambling Addiction?</strong></h2>\n<p>Gambling is a diverse activity, so different types of gambling addiction exist as well. It is not always obvious when someone is addicted to gambling. Contrary to popular belief, the act of gambling is not restricted to slot machines, cards and casinos. Purchasing a lottery ticket, entering a raffle or making a bet with a friend are also forms of gambling.</p>\n<p>Gambling addiction can occur when a person feels that they are in financial ruin and can only solve their problems by gambling what little they have in an attempt to get a large sum of money. Unfortunately, this almost always leads to a cycle in which the gambler feels they must win back their losses, and the cycle goes on until the person is forced to seek rehabilitation to break their habit.</p>\n<p>Another type of gambling addiction results when a gambler plays the games and makes risky bets to experience the emotional high associated with taking huge risks that occasionally pay off. In both cases, the person affected by this addiction must have the desire to stop the behavior, not just to please family and friends. If you, or a loved one, want to stop gambling but don&rsquo;t not know where to begin, call our hotline at for the resources necessary to start the recovery process.</p>\n<h2><strong>What Causes an Addiction to Gambling?</strong></h2>\n<p>Many factors can contribute to a gambling addiction, including desperation for money, the desire to experience thrills and highs, the social status associated with being a successful gambler, and the entertaining atmosphere of the mainstream gambling scene. Unfortunately, once a gambling addiction takes hold, breaking the cycle is difficult. Severe addictions can take hold when someone feels desperate financially and wants to make back what they have lost. Once the person finally wins, while they may end up collecting a massive amount of money from that win, it is rarely enough to cover what has already been lost. Most gamblers never even come close to breaking even.</p>\n<h2><strong>What Are the Signs of a Gambling Problem?</strong></h2>\n<p>The signs of a gambling problem are often the same as the signs of other addictions. Common signs of addiction include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Feeling the need to be secretive about gambling</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having trouble controlling gambling habits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gambling when you cannot afford to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your friends and family express concern about your gambling</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, as with any other addiction, the hallmark sign of a gambling problem is that you feel you cannot stop. If you feel like you need to try just one more time, or if you feel anxious when you think about quitting, it is highly likely you are suffering from a gambling addiction. If you think you or your loved one may be suffering from a gambling addiction, call to talk about the signs of a gambling addiction and your individual situation.</p>\n<p>Excessive gambling often causes a multitude of emotional symptoms, including <a href=\"https://www.psychguides.com/guides/anxiety-disorder-symptoms-causes-and-effects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>anxiety</u></a>, depression, and even suicidal thoughts and tendencies. In extreme situations, these thoughts may lead a gambler to actually making an attempt to end their life. Losing everything to gambling is devastating and leaves many people feeling completely hopeless.</p>\n<h2><strong>Physical Symptoms of Excessive Gambling</strong></h2>\n<p>Because gambling can cause depression, anxiety and self-harming tendencies, several physical signs are to be watched out for. <a href=\"https://www.psychguides.com/depression/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Depression</u></a> and anxiety sometimes lead to sleep deprivation, which may result in pale skin, weight gain or weight loss, acne and dark circles under the eyes.</p>\n<h2><strong>Short-Term and Long-Term Effects of a Gambling Addiction</strong></h2>\n<p>Gambling is associated with many additional effects, in both the short- and long-term. Gambling addiction frequently results in other addictions that serve as coping mechanisms for people who are stressed out by the activity. Many gamblers turn to drugs, alcohol and other activities to alleviate the anxiety brought on by the gambling lifestyle. Even if a gambler never experiences financial ruin as a result of the lifestyle, they may struggle with drug and alcohol addiction for the rest of life after self-medicating to deal with the stress. Also, relationships are often permanently damaged as a result of gambling.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is There a Test or Self-Assessment I Can Do?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you think you may have a gambling problem, ask yourself whether you would be okay if you stopped gambling right now. If you feel anxious or as if you shouldn&rsquo;t stop yet, chances are you are suffering from a gambling addiction. However, if you are not sure, call our hotline any time at to speak with someone who can help you assess whether or not you have a problem and need help to recover.</p>\n<h2><strong>Medication: Are There Drug Options for Gambling Disorders?</strong></h2>\n<p>While gambling cannot be directly treated with medication, it is possible to alleviate the anxiety and depression that results from gambling and often lead to it in the first place.</p>\n<h2><strong>Drugs: Possible Options</strong></h2>\n<p>The most common way to <a href=\"https://www.psychguides.com/behavioral-disorders/gambling-addiction/how-to-help/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>treat a gambling problem</u></a> with medication is to prescribe anti-anxiety and antidepressant medicines. Feeling depressed and anxious often exacerbates gambling addiction, so treating these disorders may make it easier to break the cycle and get back to a normal life.</p>\n<h2><strong>Medication Side Effects</strong></h2>\n<p>As with just about any medication, certain side effects are associated with antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. Some of these medications may make you feel worse before you feel better. For detailed information on the side effects of various depression and anxiety medications, consult your psychiatrist, or call our hotline at for advice. Remember, you should never try to self-medicate for anxiety or depression. These disorders are serious, and self-medication can be extremely dangerous.</p>\n<h2><strong>Antidepressant Drug Addiction, Dependence and Withdrawal in Gamblers</strong></h2>\n<p>While anxiety and depression medications are often highly successful helpers on the path to recovery, it is possible to become addicted to these medications as well. For this reason, it is often a good idea to enroll in an inpatient treatment center while you recover from your addiction, so a trained team of professionals can monitor you for dependence and withdrawal symptoms related to your medications.</p>\n<h2><strong>Medication Overdose</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the major problems associated with medications is that many of them do provide a high if you take more than the prescribed amount. Many gamblers are looking for that high, so prescription drug abuse is rampant among gamblers who are in the process of recovery and feel the need to get that high from something else. Overdose is one of many risks associated with substance abuse, and it is one of the reasons inpatient treatment centers are always recommended for anyone recovering from an addiction to gambling.</p>\n<h2><strong>Depression and Gambling</strong></h2>\n<p>Because gambling addiction is often associated with depression, watch out for signs that you are, or your loved one is, suffering from this debilitating disorder. Lethargy, fatigue, change in appetite and unhappiness are several symptoms out of many that someone is suffering from depression. Depression is often not something that can be controlled easily. If you suspect you or your loved one is suffering from depression, call us at .</p>\n<h2><strong>Dual Diagnosis: Substance Abuse and Gambling</strong></h2>\n<p>A dual diagnosis means that someone who is suffering from an addiction to substances or gambling is diagnosed with the addiction along with a <a href=\"https://www.psychguides.com/mental-health-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>mental health disorder</u></a>. Dual diagnosis treatment is needed to effectively address <a rel=\"nofollow\"><u>both issues</u></a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Getting Help to Quit Gambling</strong></h2>\n<p>Quitting gambling is no easy feat, but it can be done with the help of a solid support group and treatment program. It can be difficult to get started on the path to recovery without the assistance of professionals who have helped people through the process before. Supportive friends and family are vital to a full recovery, but they might not know how best to help you.</p>"

Gambling disorders affect 0.2&ndash;5.3% of adults worldwide, although measurement and prevalence varies according to the screening instruments and methods used, and availability and accessibility of gambling opportunities. Several distinct treatment approaches have been favorably evaluated, such as cognitive behavioral and brief treatment models and pharmacological interventions. Although promising, family therapy and support from Gamblers Anonymous are less well empirically supported. Gambling disorders are highly comorbid with other mental health and substance use disorders, and a further understanding is needed of both the causes and treatment implications of this disorder. This article reviews definition, causes and associated features with substance abuse, screening and diagnosis, and treatment approaches.</h2>\n<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>This paper offers a balanced review of major contemporary perspectives on substance abuse and gambling. This paper should be of great assistance to the reader in developing the multidisciplinary foundation that is unique to the addictive behaviors such as gambling and substance use and treatment fields. We do hope that students and in-service professionals find the review of theory and research to be provocative enough to cause them to reconsider their conceptions of gambling and substance use. This paper should serve to strengthen understanding of divers theoretical perspectives on addictive behavior such as gambling and substance use in helping communities and individuals effectively address these problems.</p>\n<h2>DEFINITIONS OF GAMBLING</h2>\n<p>Wildman[<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361844/#ref1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>1</u></a>] suggests that the important thing to remember about gambling is that it is &ldquo;a conscious, deliberate effort to stake valuables, usually but not always currency, on how some event happens to turn out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are also &ldquo;quasi-gambling&rdquo; activities, such as stock market and real estate investments that can be used as opportunities to gamble, and so must be counted in any survey of gambling activity. How often a person is involved as well as the sum of money involved may be used as a rough criterion for considering an activity as &ldquo;gambling.&rdquo; It has also been suggested that unless there is some sort of excitement or thrill involved in the pursuit of an activity, it probably isnot gambling. Some people, for instance, do not consider buying lottery tickets or raffle tickets for charitable purposes as gambling, and yet there is clearly some anticipation or excitement involved in the purchase of these tickets, whether or not a large amount of money or time is invested in their purchase. A combination of excitement and level of involvement is perhaps the best means to determine what is or isnot gambling. The limits of what is considered &ldquo;gambling&rdquo; behaviour have shaped the definitions of &ldquo;problem&rdquo; gambling that are used, and how problem gambling is measured. Wildman[<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361844/#ref1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>1</u></a>] provided a useful summary of the theories that explain why people gamble. All of these explanations are used to treat people affected by problem gambling. For those who believe that gambling was an important behaviour in human evolution, as well as for those who look at gambling as a generator of excitement and stimulation, the biological school of thought on problem gambling suggests that there are genetic predispositions toward gambling &mdash; problem gambling in particular. Thus, measurable chemical changes occur in someone who either has this predisposition, or who develops problem gambling behaviour. Medical treatment is necessary in these cases.</p>\n<p>A more behavioural approach to gambling and problem gambling believes these behaviors derive from social learning, either as a focus of socialization, or a result of reinforcement. This approach also encompasses the personification of luck, and other superstitious forms of thinking often seen in social and people affected by problem gambling, a manifestation of &ldquo;primitive magical or religious ceremonies&rdquo;. Cognitive behavioural treatment approaches are the logical approach if gambling behaviour is seen as linked to specific environments or subject to specific triggers.</p>\n<p>Those who see gambling as a rational behaviour might be more likely to suggest that gamblers a) see that gambling is strictly for fun, or b) feel that they can make a profit at it. Cognitive behavioural approaches to gambling problems are also the most likely means of treatment for those who see gambling as a rational behaviour. Teaching gamblers the odds of their favorite games often changes their belief that gambling can be profitable. However, none of the explanations for gambling behaviour outlined in the table above provide an appropriate rationale as to why some gamblers develop gambling problems. For that, we need to look at a multi-dimensional approach. For instance, Wildman suggests that all of these explanations may be present, to varying degrees, in the same individual.</p>\n<h2>GAMBLING ADDICTION</h2>\n<p>Problem gambling is an urge to gamble despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to stop. The term is preferred to compulsive gambling among many professionals, as few people described by the term experience true compulsions in the clinical sense of the word. Problem gambling often is defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler's behavior. Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical pathological gambling if the gambler meets certain criteria.</p>\n<p>Problem gambling has most often been conceptualized and defined in the past as an addiction or medical problem, because this was a familiar framework for both policy makers and clinicians, and because of the surface similarities between gambling problems and alcohol and other drug problems. Rosenthal's definition is perhaps the best place to start in terms of defining problem gambling, because it is broadly accepted by psychiatrists, many psychologists, and Gamblers Anonymous members, and is also the foundation for the influential Diagnostic and Statistical Manual's criteria for problem gambling:</p>\n<p>A progressive disorder characterized by a continuous or periodic loss of control over gambling; a preoccupation with gambling and with obtaining money with which to gamble; irrational thinking; and a continuation of the behaviour despite adverse consequences.</p>\n<p>This definition, like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, is behaviorally based, and sees gambling as a disorder that one either has or doesnot have. It captures most of the important behaviors that are seen with severe problem gambling, but only indirectly includes the consequences of gambling. Of course, it is because of the consequences that most gamblers end up in treatment. In addition, by calling gambling a &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; the definition suggests that those who have gambling problems are in some qualitative way different from those who do not. The literature suggests that this is not true.</p>\n<h2>PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLING</h2>\n<p>Extreme cases of problem gambling may cross over into the realm of mental disorders. Pathological gambling was recognized as a psychiatric disorder in the DSM-III, but the criteria were significantly reworked based on large-scale studies and statistical methods for the DSM- IV. As defined by American Psychiatric Association, pathological gambling is an impulse control disorder that is a chronic and progressive mental illness.</p>\n<p>Pathological gambling is now defined as persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior meeting at least five of the following criteria, as long as these behaviors are not better explained by a manic episode:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<div>Preoccupation. The subject has frequent thoughts about gambling experiences, whether past, future, or fantasy</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Tolerance. As with drug tolerance, the subject requires larger or more frequent wagers to experience the same &ldquo;rush&rdquo;</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Withdrawal. Restlessness or irritability associated with attempts to cease or reduce gambling</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Escape. The subject gambles to improve mood or escape problems</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Chasing. The subject tries to win back gambling losses with more gambling</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Lying. The subject tries to hide the extent of his or her gambling by lying to family, friends, or therapists</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Loss of control. The subject has unsuccessfully attempted to reduce gambling</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Illegal acts. The subject has broken the law in order to obtain gambling money or recover gambling losses</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Risked significant relationship. The subject gambles despite risking or losing a relationship, job, or other significant opportunity</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Bailout. The subject turns to family, friends, or another third party for financial assistance as a result of gambling</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Biological bases. The subject has a lack of norepinephrine.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As with many disorders, the DSM-IV definition of pathological gambling is widely accepted and used as a basis for research and clinical practice internationally.</p>\n<h2>BIOLOGICAL BASES</h2>\n<p>According to the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery Recent evidence indicates that pathological gambling is an addiction similar to chemical addiction. It has been seen that some pathological gamblers have lower levels of norepinephrine than normal gamblers.</p>\n<p>According to a study conducted by Alec Roy, M.D. formerly at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, norepinephrine is secreted under stress, arousal, or thrill, so pathological gamblers gamble to make up for their under dosage.</p>\n<p>Further to this, according to a report from the Harvard Medical School Division on Addictions there was an experiment constructed where test subjects were presented with situations where they could win, lose or break even in a casino-like environment. Subjects&rsquo; reactions were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a neuron-imaging device similar to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). And according to Hans Breiter, MD, co-director of the motivation and Emotion Neuroscience Centre at the Massachusetts General Hospital, &ldquo;Monetary reward in a gambling-like experiment produces brain activation very similar to that observed in a cocaine addict receiving an infusion of cocaine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Deficiencies in serotonin might also contribute to compulsive behavior, including a gambling addiction.</p>\n<div>\n<h2>RELATION TO OTHER PROBLEMS</h2>\n<p>As debts build up people turn to other sources of money such as theft, or the sale of drugs. A lot of this pressure comes from bookies or loan sharks that people rely on for capital to gamble with. Also, a teenager that does not receive treatment for pathological gambling when in their desperation phase is likely to contemplate suicide. A total of 20% of teenagers that are pathological gamblers do consider suicide. This according to the article High Stakes: Teens Gambling with Their Futures by Laura Paul.</p>\n<p>Abuse is also common in homes where pathological gambling is present. Growing up in such a situation leads to improper emotional development and increased risk of falling prey to problem gambling behavior. Pathological gambling is similar to many other impulse control disorders such as kleptomania, pyromania, and trichotillomania. Other mental diseases that also exhibit impulse control disorder include such mental disorders as antisocial personality disorder or schizophrenia.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>PREVALENCE</h2>\n<p>According to a variety of sources, the prevalence (i.e., extent of existing cases) of problem gambling is 2-3% and pathological gambling is 1% in the United States, though this may vary by country. By contrast, about 86% of Americans have gambled during their lives and 60% gamble in a given year. Interestingly, despite the widespread growth in gambling availability and the increase in lifetime gambling during that past 25 years, past year problem gambling has remained steady. Currently, there is little evidence on the incidence of problem gambling (i.e., new cases).</p>\n<p>Available research seems to indicate that problem gambling is an internal tendency, and that problem gamblers will tend to risk money on whatever game is available, rather than a particular game being available inducing problem gambling in otherwise &ldquo;normal&rdquo; individuals. However, research also indicates that problem gamblers tend to risk money on fast-paced games. Thus, a problem gambler is much more likely to lose a lot of money on poker or slot machines, where rounds end quickly and there is a constant temptation to play again or increase bets, as opposed to a state lottery where the gambler must wait until the next drawing to see results. Dopamine agonists, in particular pramipexole (Mirapex), have been implicated in the development of compulsive gambling and other excessive behavior patterns.</p>\n<h2>GAMBLING AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE: A COMPARISON</h2>\n<p>Gambling is commonly thought of as an addiction, even though it is not included with other addictions in the DSM-IV. In describing diagnostic categories for problems related to alcohol and other drugs, the DSM-IV uses the term substance-related disorders, which includes, among others, alcohol, amphetamines and caffeine. Gambling problems are referred to as pathological gambling, which is listed as one of six disorders under impulse-control disorders.</p>\n<p>The DSM-IV recognizes two levels of severity with the substance-related disorders &mdash; substance dependence and substance abuse. Substance dependence is distinguished from substance abuse by several diagnostic criteria, the most significant difference being that the presence of tolerance and withdrawal are required for a diagnosis of dependence. If tolerance and/or withdrawal are present, a diagnosis of abuse cannot be made. In comparison, only one level of problem severity is considered for gambling &mdash; pathological gambling.</p>\n<p>A review of the diagnostic criteria of these disorders suggests some similarity between them. Substance dependence is described as &ldquo;a maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress.&rdquo; The DSM-IV then itemizes seven diagnostic criteria, of which at least three need to be present during a 12-month period to warrant a diagnosis of substance dependence. The same definition is used for substance abuse, with only one diagnostic criterion needing to be present during a 12-month period to warrant the diagnosis. However, it is essential to note that although the description for abuse is the same as dependence, the diagnostic criteria are much different. Most notably, the criteria of tolerance and withdrawal, which are included in the criteria for dependence, are absent in the diagnostic criteria for abuse.</p>\n<p>Pathological gambling is described as &ldquo;persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behaviour,&rdquo; similar to the description for substance dependence and abuse. There are 10 diagnostic criteria, of which at least five need to be present to warrant a diagnosis of pathological gambling. The criteria are worded in the present tense, suggesting that the criteria need to be present at the time of the diagnostic interview to warrant the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>An examination of the respective diagnostic criteria indicates a similarity between the disorders. For example, two of the criteria for substance dependence are tolerance and withdrawal; two concepts most commonly associated with the ingestion of a substance, like alcohol or other drugs. Tolerance in relation to substance dependence is described as a need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect. One of the criteria for pathological gambling is a need to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. This is quite similar to the definition of tolerance.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the concept of withdrawal, described in the criteria for substance dependence as &ldquo;the development of a substance-specific syndrome due to the cessation or reduction in substance use that has been heavy and prolonged,&rdquo; is also identified as a criterion for pathological gambling. It is not labeled as withdrawal, but is described as being restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.</p>\n<p>Another criterion for substance dependence includes &ldquo;a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.&rdquo; Pathological gambling involves &ldquo;&hellip;repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Additional similarities include the presence of preoccupation, compromising social, occupational or recreational activities and legal problems (which are not included in the criteria for dependence).</p>\n<p>The criteria depart in only two areas of diagnosis. Substance dependence includes a criterion that refers to the substance use continuing despite the individual knowing that continued use of the substance is likely to result in recurrent physical or psychological problems. The criteria for pathological gambling do not address this issue. On the other hand, the criteria for pathological gambling emphasize the negative impact on family and friends in three criteria, while impact on others is not addressed in the criteria for substance dependence.</p>\n<p>It is not clear why pathological gambling is positioned with impulse control disorders in the DSM-IV, since there appears to be more similarities between pathological gambling and substance-related disorders than there are between pathological gambling and impulse-control disorders, at least in terms of their diagnostic criteria.</p>\n<p>In a more general sense, Marlatt <em><em>et al</em></em>. defined addictive behaviour as:</p>\n<p>A repetitive habit pattern that increases the risk of disease and/or associate personal and social problems. Addictive behaviors are often experienced subjectively as &ldquo;loss of control&rdquo; &mdash; the behaviour contrives to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. These habit patterns are typically characterized by immediate gratification, often coupled with delayed, deleterious effects. Attempts to change an addictive behaviour (via treatment or self initiation) are typically marked with high relapse rates.</p>\n<p>From Marlatt's definition, gambling and substance disorders share a number of addictive behaviour characteristics, again suggesting a phenomenological similarity.</p>\n<p>Many similarities exist in terms of how substance dependence/abuse and pathological gambling are treated. Professional and self-help interventions are available for both disorders. The concept of matching the individual to the appropriate professional or self-help (or both) intervention appears to be an important factor in determining outcomes for both disorders. Substance dependence treatment relies more on residential services, including withdrawal management and treatment, than does pathological gambling. Medical intervention is likely more frequently required for individuals with substance dependence.</p>\n<p>There is a similar range of therapeutic modalities and orientations available for both disorders, including individual, group and family modalities, as well as cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic approaches.</p>\n<p>Substance abuse and gambling share a common controversy in treatment planning: Abstinence vs. reduced use/gambling as a treatment goal. The scientific research and ideological argument on substance dependency and abuse has been well documented. Far less research has been done into the viability of goals of reduced gambling, but the ideological argument for and against abstinence/reduced goals has been imported from the substance abuse literature into the gambling literature. It remains a contentious issue in both fields.</p>\n<p>Both disorders are recognized to have potentially serious deleterious effects on family members. Recent literature on children of alcoholics identifies the developmental, interpersonal, and emotional issues involved in a family where there is a parent with a substance dependency or abuse problem. Studies on children of pathological gamblers have found increased health-threatening behaviors (such as smoking, overeating, substance abuse, gambling), dysphoria, and deficits in functioning.</p>\n<p>One significant difference between the two disorders is that problem gambling is recognized as a more cognitively based disorder than substance dependence or abuse. Most researchers have concluded that excessive gamblers characteristically demonstrate core cognitive distortions in their belief systems about their ability to win at gambling. These beliefs can persist even when the gambler continues to lose at gambling. It is essential to assess the gambler's beliefs about his or her ability to win. Some gamblers also have cognitive distortions not only about their ability to win, but also their need for excitement, and a correlating distorted belief that they will not be able to function without the excitement that they derive from gambling. Cognitive therapy is required to identify, challenge, and modify cognitive distortions, or relapse to gambling is likely (because the gambler believes that he or she is going to win if he or she gambles). Other interventions may be appropriate and effective (e.g., behavioural therapy, family therapy, impulse control training, etc.), but cognitive assessment and therapy will be a cornerstone of the treatment plan.</p>\n<p>Substance abuse may involve minimizing one's use, and an underestimation of the effect one's use has on life areas as well as family members may be evident. However, these characteristics are typically interpreted as defense mechanisms (unconscious attempts to deal with what are perceived as attacks against one's ego, or self), rather than, as in problem gambling, cognitive distortions in one's belief system &mdash; misinterpreting the outcomes and cause-effect relationships involved in gambling.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of treatment planning, and treatment where the two disorders vary distinctly, is in relation to the gambler's financial situation. Treatment for pathological gambling typically includes a major focus on financial assessment, which includes issues like access to cash; cheque control, credit card control, debt resolution strategies, and financial planning (refer to Section 5.2, &ldquo;Finances and the Gambling Client&rdquo;). A financial crisis is often the issue that prompts a gambler to seek counseling. Because many gamblers are heavily indebted, attempting to deal with indebtedness by returning to gambling to win money (a cognitive distortion) can be a relapse factor if their financial crisis is not addressed and managed appropriately. It is not uncommon, particularly in the early stages of counseling, to suggest that the gambler surrender access and control of financial matters to his spouse, or another trusted person, as a preventive measure. Preventing or reducing access to money (and therefore eliminating the means to gamble) is considered good practice.</p>\n<p>Counselors must be completely comfortable discussing money management with clients, including incomes, net worth, financial liabilities (credit cards, mortgage, loans), and budgeting. This requires not only the knowledge to advise the client on these matters (or to refer them), but also being psychologically comfortable doing so.</p>\n<p>Clients with substance abuse problems may also have some financial pressures related to the cost of their use, but money and financial issues do not take a central role in the treatment plan as they do with counseling gamblers. For many counselors not accustomed to working with gamblers, this approach may represent a dramatic departure from how they might typically counsel alcohol- and drug-using clients. Accepting and dealing with the integral role of financial matters with gambling clients may require professional development for the substance abuse counselor.</p>\n<h2>TREATMENTS OF GAMBLING ADDICTION</h2>\n<p><br />Every gambler is unique and so needs a recovery program tailored specifically to him or her. What works for one gambler will not necessarily work for you. The biggest step in treatment is realizing you have a problem with gambling. It takes tremendous strength and courage to own up to this, especially if you have lost a lot of money and strained or broken relationships along the way. Do not despair and do not try to go it alone. Many others have been in your shoes and have been able to break the habit.</p>\n<div>\n<h3>Gamblers anonymous</h3>\n<p>Is a twelve-step recovery program patterned after Alcoholics Anonymous. A key part of a 12-step program is choosing a sponsor. A sponsor is a former gambler who has time and experience remaining free from addiction and can often provide invaluable guidance and support.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</h3>\n<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for problem gambling focuses on changing unhealthy gambling behaviors and thoughts, such as rationalizations and false beliefs. It also teaches problem gamblers how to fight gambling urges, deal with uncomfortable emotions rather than escapes through gambling, and solve financial, work, and relationship problems caused by the addiction. The goal of treatment is to &ldquo;rewire&rdquo; the addicted brain by thinking about gambling in a new way. A variation of cognitive behavioral therapy, called the four steps program, has been used in treatment of compulsive gambling as well. The goal is to change your thoughts and beliefs about gambling in four steps; re-label, re-attribute, refocus, and revalue.</p>\n<p>What is cognitive behavioral therapy? CBT is a form of psychotherapy that emphasizes the role of thinking in how we feel and in what we do. There are actually several different types of CBT, but what they are is not as important as what they can do. Each of them is time-limited. That is, they do not last forever. Patients do not continue to go for CBT sessions for years like they would for traditional psychotherapy. Instead, they take place for a certain period of time, usually about 16 sessions. CBT is a collaborative process between the therapist and the patient. It is based on the idea that our thoughts cause our feelings and behaviors, and not external people, places, and things. The benefit of getting CBT is that patients/clients can change the way that they think to feel and/or act better &ndash; even if the situation does not change.</p>\n<p>Compulsive and problem gamblers often need the support of their family and friends to help them in their struggle to stop gambling. But the decision to quit has to be theirs. As much as you may want to, and as hard as it is seeing the effects, you cannot make someone stop gambling.</p>\n<p>If a family member has a gambling problem, other members of family may have many conflicting emotions. They may try to cover up for a loved one or spend a lot of time and energy trying to keep him or her from gambling. At the same time, they might be furious at their loved one for gambling again and tired of trying to keep up the charade. The gambler may also have borrowed (or even stolen) money from other family members with no way to pay it back. He or she may have sold family possessions or run up huge debts on joint credit cards. When faced with the consequences of their actions, a gambler can suffer a crushing drop in self-esteem. This is one reason why there is a high rate of suicide among problem gamblers.</p>\n<p>When someone has an addiction problem the best thing is, of course, that he comes out of that situation himself. However, this requires a lot of self-discipline and motivation from the gambler. If he can&rsquo;t do it on his own, there are several possibilities to get help. But in this case too, the success of the treatment depends on the motivation of the gambler to handle the addiction. In the first place, there are self-help groups run by Gambling Anonymous (GA). They work more or less the same way as the Alcohol Anonymous groups (AA). The basic thought of these groups is that you have an addiction problem and will always have an addiction problem, even if you never drink alcohol again or do not gamble anymore. The only thing you can do is to stop gambling because you will never be able to deal with the pleasures of gambling.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is ambulatory assistance, for example, through outpatients&rsquo; clinics of psychiatric hospitals or addiction institutions, or through clinics for alcohol and drugs abuse. By having conversations with the patient, a solution is sought for his problems. Also debt restructuring can be part of this therapy. In more serious cases, admission to a clinic is necessary. The treatment of a gambling addiction is mainly focused on helping the patient to stop gambling. In this period, the treatment is aimed at an inventory of the problems; a list of debts is made and a plan is developed to pay them off, deals are made about who controls the money, relationship problems are dealt with, and underlying problems are looked at. Sometimes, gambling has to do with the sudden death of people around the person, neglect, or feelings of inferiority. Sometimes stopping gambling leads to serious psychological and somatic problems. It is preferable to involve partners or parents during the treatment. The people around the addict often turn out to have this need. They can play an important role in the arrangements about the control of money, debt repayment, etc. The treatment lasts on an average of 6 months.</p>\n</div>\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<h1><strong>Gambling addiction can cause psychological, physiological health challenges</strong></h1>\n<p>Gambling dates back to at least the first millennium BC, eventually evolving into a widespread source of entertainment. However, along with its growing popularity, gambling also has led to significant financial loss and psychological and physical hardship.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/timothy-fong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Timothy W. Fong</a>, clinical professor of Psychiatry at the <a href=\"https://www.semel.ucla.edu/psychiatry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA</a>, discussed how gambling can affect the mind, body and brain.</p>\n<p>The health impact has been magnified during the pandemic, as more and more people have turned to gambling, experts say.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wide range of consequences that comes with gambling disorder (formerly referred to as gambling addiction or problem gambling). Like any addiction, the damage can be to a person&rsquo;s body, their brain or their mind,&rdquo; Dr. Fong said. &ldquo;But the common problems we see when people come into treatment are going to be things like large financial debt, a loss of time, loss of productivity and damaged relationships.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dr. Fong noted that studies have found when people struggle with gambling disorder, chances are they are going to have related health problems stemming from stress, lack of sleep and even heart problems. Much of those health issues are associated with large debts accrued from gambling and from not taking time for self-care or health maintenance.</p>\n<h2>Cognitively similar to drugs</h2>\n<p>Like addictive drugs such as cocaine, heroin, nicotine and alcohol, gambling activates the brain&rsquo;s reward system, which is powered by dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter inside the brain that reinforces sensations of pleasure and connects those sensations to certain behaviors or actions.</p>\n<p>Dr. Fong, however, highlighted a significant contrast between gambling and addictive substances.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Gambling, unlike any other addiction, is associated with cognitive distortions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People say, &lsquo;If I keep gambling then eventually I&rsquo;ll win.&rsquo; You don&rsquo;t say that about alcohol, tobacco or cocaine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The cognitive distortion often takes place within people who have lost large amounts of money or other assets due to gambling. Sometimes their pride, ego or sense of despair drives them to gamble more, in hopes of making back what they lost, Dr. Fong said.</p>\n<h2>What causes a gambling disorder?</h2>\n<p>There are multiple reasons for why someone might become addicted to gambling.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as what causes any other addiction. It&rsquo;s a combination of biological risk factors, psychological risk factors and social risk factors,&rdquo; Dr. Fong said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It can be someone with a family history of addiction; someone who has untreated mental health problems like depression, anxiety, ADHD; or someone who is around a lot of gambling, with access to money and it sets up a recipe as to why people fall into problems,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Dr. Fong explained that people with gambling disorder psychologically view gambling as the answer to their problems. When they are at this point with their addiction, gambling is no longer seen as entertainment. They now view gambling as a means to cope with anxiety or stress, or as their primary source of income.</p>\n<h2>Gambling during the pandemic</h2>\n<p>Dr. Fong said the pandemic could be one reason that gambling has increased recently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our experience at the <a href=\"http://www.uclagamblingprogram.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UCLA Gambling Studies Program</a> is that there are more opportunities to gamble during the pandemic. There were online games available and casinos stayed open,&rdquo; Dr. Fong said.</p>\n<p>Casinos and online gambling were among the few entertainment options that remained available for people during lockdowns and quarantines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, the pandemic and all of its related stress and trauma could easily drive people to begin gambling and/or return to gambling as an emotional comfort measure.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Most addictive forms of gambling</h2>\n<p>All forms of gambling are potentially addictive, Dr. Fong said. However, he said he notices a trend in California &ndash; most people coming into treatment are reporting that slot machines are their preferred form of gambling.</p>\n<p>He noted that gambling that is rapid, or that allows you to place multiple bets at one time, tend to be very addicting as well.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We know that gambling that is anonymous, where you don&rsquo;t have to interact with anyone, can be addictive,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Also gambling that is tied to really large immediate payouts like slot machines can also be enticing. When you bet small amounts trying to get the huge jackpot, that&rsquo;s definitely a risk factor.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Technology has made gambling more accessible for compulsive gamblers, with people able to place wagers from their smartphones. Some people link their credit cards to digital gambling apps and can add money with a push of the &ldquo;send&rdquo; button. Dr. Fong acknowledges that this leads to additional problems.</p>\n<h2>Assistance for people with gambling disorder</h2>\n<p>Many gambling establishments and gambling apps are putting safeguards in place for people who might have gambling disorders.</p>\n<p>Some casinos have self-exclusion programs, allowing people to ban themselves from the establishment. Some gambling apps have installed software that allows users to manage their gambling impulses.</p>\n<p>Though a gambling disorder can cause myriad problems, there are ways to overcome it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If they come into the office, we do what we do for any other addictive disorder,&rdquo; Dr. Fong said. &ldquo;We do psychotherapy, we have Gamblers Anonymous, we have medication, and strategies to get people to work hard on their recovery, where their addiction can be contained.&rdquo;</p>\n"

Due to the high level of accessibility, immersive interface and ease at which money can be spent, concerns have been expressed that Internet gambling may increase rates of disordered gambling. The current paper aimed to provide an overview of the research to date as well as highlight new and interesting findings relevant to Internet gambling addiction. A comprehensive review of the existing literature was conducted to provide an overview of significant trends and developments in research that relates to disordered Internet gambling. This paper presents research to inform a greater understanding of adult participation in Internet gambling, features of this interface that may impact problem severity, the relationship between Internet gambling and related problems, as well as considering the role of the wider spectrum of gambling behaviour and relevant individual factors that moderate this relationship.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Internet gambling (a term largely interchangeable with interactive remote and online gambling) refers to the range of wagering and gaming activities offered through Internet-enabled devices, including computers, mobile and smart phones, tablets and digital television. This mode of gambling, facilitated by technological advances, increased Internet availability and ownership of Internet-enabled devices, is not a separate type of gambling activity. Rather it is a mode of access that is distinct from gambling in person at terrestrial or land-based retail outlets and placing wagers over the telephone. As such, it is a largely automated activity that could be conducted in private, at any time and location, using high-speed Internet connections enabling rapid placement of bets and notification of outcomes. The ability for large wagers, continuous gambling, rapid feedback and instant, easy access to a vast number of betting options has resulted in concerns that Internet gambling could contribute to excessive gambling.</p>\n<p>As a result of the empirical comparisons demonstrating the fundamental parallels between gambling problems and substance use, the fifth edition of the <em><em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em></em> (DSM-5) includes a new category of Non-Substance Behavioural Addiction within the substance addictions category. Disordered gambling is classified as the first behavioural addiction and will serve as a &lsquo;blueprint&rsquo; for research on other syndromes and arguably set a precedent for the compilation of evidence on other similarly excessive behaviours such as &lsquo;Internet gaming disorder&rsquo; (currently in section 3 of the DSM-5). Mounting evidence of distress and dysfunction related to excessive and problematic Internet use and specifically Internet gaming led the DSM-5 Taskforce to officially call for further research on this behaviour. Given the similarities in the experience and excessive use of Internet gambling and gaming and the potential for harm based on excessive Internet use, pathological use of Internet gambling also warrants specific consideration. The current paper aimed to provide an overview of the research to date as well as highlight new and interesting findings relevant to adult Internet gambling addiction. A comprehensive review of the existing literature was conducted to provide an overview of significant trends and developments in research that relates to disordered Internet gambling.</p>\n<div>\n<h2>Participation</h2>\n<p>Internet gambling is growing rapidly in terms of popularity, market share and products offered. The online global gambling market was valued at &euro;6.1 billion in 2013, with expected annual growth of 10.1&nbsp;% in 2018. Online gambling accounted for an estimated 8&ndash;10&nbsp;% of the total global gambling market in 2012, and this proportion appears to be increasing. Globally, the largest online gambling product is wagering, accounting for 53&nbsp;% of the online gambling market, followed by casino games (including slot machines/pokies/electronic gaming machines, 25.4&nbsp;%), poker (14.2&nbsp;%), and bingo (7.4&nbsp;%).</p>\n<p>Internationally, an increasing number of jurisdictions are legalizing and regulating Internet gambling. This follows recognition of the difficulties of enforcing prohibition and the benefits of regulation, including requiring harm minimization measures to enhance consumer protection, and generating taxation revenue. Although the prevalence of Internet gambling appears to be relatively low, participation is increasing rapidly, particularly in jurisdictions that permit access to regulated sites. For example, in Australia following the legalization of Internet wagering and lottery playing, prevalence rates in Internet gambling rose from less than 1&nbsp;% in 1999 to 8.1&nbsp;% in 2011. Similarly in the UK, an average of 16&nbsp;% of respondents had participated in at least one form of online gambling in the previous 4&nbsp;weeks. In comparison, only 6&nbsp;% of the British population used the Internet to gamble in the past year in 2007, although this figure does not include purchasing lottery tickets online, which may have increased the participation rate.</p>\n<p>Internet gambling use is likely to continue to grow as online platforms become increasingly used to engage in entertainment and recreational activities, including through phones and other wireless devices. Research suggests that the most commonly reported motivators and advantages of Internet gambling are the convenience and accessibility of this mode. Other commonly stated advantages of Internet gambling include greater value for money, including payout rates and bonuses, the speed and ease of online gambling, greater number of betting products and options and the physical comfort of being able to gamble from home.</p>\n<p>Internet gambling represents a fundamental shift in how consumers engage in gambling, and concerns have been expressed by various stakeholders about these changes. Disadvantages cited by Internet gamblers include that it is easier to spend money online, it is too convenient and concerns about account safety. Other concerns include that the high accessibility to Internet gambling may increase gambling, particularly among technology-savvy youth, and lead to an increase in the incidence and prevalence of disordered gambling. These concerns have led to recommendations for Internet gambling to be prohibited, or conversely regulated, in an attempt to institute policies to minimize harms.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Internet Gambling and Problem Gambling</h2>\n<div>\n<h3>Features of Internet Gambling That May Impact Problem Severity</h3>\n<p>Evidence suggests that there is a relationship, albeit complex, between the availability of gambling opportunities and increased levels of related problems. Consequently, it has been asserted that the easy access to gambling provided by Internet modes may lead to the development or exacerbation of gambling problems.</p>\n<p>Internet gambling also has some unique features that may pose additional risks for harm, particularly for vulnerable populations. Internet gambling differs from land-based gambling primarily in terms of its constant availability, easy access and ability to bet for uninterrupted periods in private, facilitated by the interactive and immersive Internet environment. The use of digital forms of money (e.g. credit cards, electronic bank transfers and e-wallets) appears to lead to increased gambling and losses, particularly for problem gamblers, as people feel that they are not spending &lsquo;real&rsquo; money. Surveys indicate that 19&ndash;28&nbsp;% of online gamblers report it is easier to spend more money online, while 15&nbsp;% consider this form to be more addictive than land-based gambling.</p>\n<p>The immersive nature of Internet gambling is also clear through reports that online gamblers, particularly those experiencing problems, are more likely to report disruption to their sleep and eating patterns than land-based gamblers. Data collected by gambling treatment services suggest that Internet gambling currently makes a small, but growing, contribution to gambling problems among those seeking formal help. Surveys have found that online problem gamblers are significantly less likely to have sought formal help as compared to land-based problem gamblers. This suggests that problems related to Internet gambling may be underrepresented in treatment-seeking samples and are likely to increase over time as more people participate in this mode and problem severity increases.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>The Relationships Between Internet Gambling and Gambling Problems</h3>\n<p>Initial concerns over the harmful effects of Internet gambling are sensible as numerous studies have found greater levels of problem gambling severity amongst samples of Internet as compared to non-Internet gamblers. For example, in an Australian nationally representative prevalence survey, the overall problem gambling rate among Australian non-Internet gamblers was 0.9&nbsp;%. In comparison, the rate among Internet gamblers was three times higher at 2.7&nbsp;%. Fewer than 60&nbsp;% of Internet gamblers were classified as non-problem gamblers, compared to more than 80&nbsp;% of non-Internet gamblers, which was a significant difference. Furthermore, the average PGSI score of Internet gamblers was significantly higher than that of non-Internet gamblers. Similarly, a total of 16.4&nbsp;% of Internet gamblers were classified as either moderate or problem gamblers, compared to a rate of 5.7&nbsp;% among non-Internet gamblers. However, there is little evidence available that would enable the causation of Internet-related gambling problems to be determined, and most longitudinal studies contain too few Internet gamblers to provide meaningful analyses.</p>\n<p>Despite some indications of a positive correlation, the relationship between Internet gambling participation and problems has not been confirmed. Some studies have found similar rates of gambling problems among Internet and land-based gamblers. Research also suggests that very few Internet gamblers gamble exclusively online. Further analyses of prevalence studies that control for factors such as demographic variables and gambling involvement have found that participation in Internet gambling does not independently predict problem gambling severity. For example, even though Internet gamblers were more likely to be classified as being at risk or experiencing gambling problems in a nationally representative survey, when other variables were controlled for, Internet gambling participation was not predictive of problem gambling severity. Similarly, using data from the 2007 British Gambling Prevalence Study, LaPlante and colleagues found that gambling formats (particularly Internet gambling) and problem gambling were not significantly related when gambling involvement was included in the model (based on the number of gambling activities used in the past 12&nbsp;months). This finding was in contrast to earlier analyses and demonstrates the importance of controlling for confounding factors.</p>\n<p>Further evidence to question the extent to which Internet gambling increases rates of problem gambling can be taken from prevalence studies. Despite rates of Internet gambling increasing in several jurisdictions, little evidence has been found to suggest that the prevalence of problem gambling has increased. An analysis across 30 European jurisdictions failed to identify any association between prohibitions against online gambling, gambling licencing systems, the extent of legal gambling opportunities and the prevalence of gambling disorder.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>The Impact of Internet and Land-Based Gambling on Gambling Problems</h3>\n<p>Evidence is emerging that Internet gambling is not only predictive of gambling problems but also that when other variables are controlled for, individuals who gamble online may have lower rates of gambling problems. Studies that have isolated Internet-only gamblers have found that these gamblers have lower rates of gambling problems than gamblers who only gamble offline and those who use both online and offline modes. Gamblers who engage in online as well as offline modes appear to have the greatest risks of harm, which is likely related to their greater overall gambling involvement.</p>\n<p>The relationship between Internet and problem gambling is likely mediated by the use of land-based gambling. A study examining actual Internet gambling account activity combined with a self-report measure of gambling problems confirmed that gambling involvement, as indicated by number of games played and days bets placed on in past year, is predictive of gambling problems amongst the sample of Internet gamblers analysed. These results are consistent with a wide body of research which suggests that gambling disorder is related to high levels of involvement (in terms of expenditure, time, frequency and variety of gambling forms used). Therefore, research suggests that highly involved gamblers are more likely to engage with Internet modes, including those with existing gambling problems, than less involved gamblers. However, a study comparing behavioural data from online gambling sites with self-report of gambling problems found that not all highly involved gamblers were at risk for gambling-related problems, and likewise, not all those with low involvement screened negatively for gambling-related problems. This is an important finding as it demonstrates (unsurprisingly) that a single gambling index (such as a frequency of gambling, or expenditure) is not adequate to predict gambling problems.</p>\n<p>Involvement in Internet gambling appears to be more likely among gamblers with existing problems as compared to non-problem gamblers. Studies have found that one third to one half of Internet gamblers experiencing gambling problems attribute these to land-based forms of gambling, and over half report that they had existing problems before they ever gambled online. This is consistent with one study reporting that problem Internet gamblers prefer land-based over Internet gambling. Few studies have investigated the types of gambling that are most likely to be associated with problems related to Internet gambling. In an Australian national survey, almost half of all gamblers stated that land-based electronic gaming machines were the primary cause of their problems, including among Internet gamblers. Internet gamblers are most likely to associate their problems with casino games, sports and race wagering and poker. In particular, sports betting appeared to be associated with moderate risk and problem gambling, a finding not replicated among land-based only gamblers. However, this finding may be specific to the Australian context as sports wagering is one of the few legal forms of online gambling.</p>\n<p>Conversely, for some Internet problem gamblers, this mode of gambling appears to be the proximal cause of problems, with problem gamblers reporting that their problems started after they first gambled online and around half specifically attributing problems to this mode. These results are consistent with other research findings, suggesting that for some problem gamblers, Internet gambling played an important causal role, while others had existing problems, which were likely exacerbated by Internet gambling. However, most studies examining the relationship between Internet gambling and problems are cross-sectional, which do not allow for causality to be determined and self-report is subject to bias and reliant on accuracy of reporting. Longitudinal research will be an important addition to this field to address these issues. As Internet gambling increases in popularity and use, it is likely that the next generation of gamblers will use Internet modes earlier in their gambling career, which may increase the proportion of individuals who experience problems that are attributed to this mode. However, there is a growing recognition that Internet gamblers are a heterogeneous group, and research needs to consider how Internet gambling behaviour may be integrated more broadly with offline gambling.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Risk Factors for Internet Gambling Problems</h2>\n<div>\n<h3>Personal Variables</h3>\n<div>\n<h4>Socio-demographic Variables</h4>\n<p>Analysis of demographic variables suggests that Internet problem gamblers overall do not represent a distinctly different cohort than gamblers who experience problems related to land-based gambling. Risk factors for Internet problem gambling identified include being male, younger adults, and being from a culturally diverse background. The consistent relationship found between problematic Internet gambling and younger age suggests that this population is particularly vulnerable to harms related to this form, and use of Internet gambling amongst young males is an area that warrants further attention in terms of research as well as harm minimisation.</p>\n<p>Risk factors identified do not appear to be universal; for example, Gainsbury, Russell, Wood, Hing and Blaszczynski found problem Internet gamblers more likely to be young, less educated and have greater debts than non-problem Internet gamblers. A subsequent study found only age differed between Internet and non-Internet problem gamblers when controlling for Internet gambling participation, and there were no significant differences based on education or income. In contrast, Jim&eacute;nez-Murcia and colleagues found that online problem gamblers had higher educational levels and higher socio-economic status than non-Internet problem gamblers; however, both groups showed similar psychopathological profiles or personality characteristics. Other studies have also found that Internet gamblers are more likely to have higher educational levels and socio-economic profiles, as well as higher levels of problem gambling than non-Internet gamblers. However, these are associations that do not control for the interaction between variables so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about problem as compared to non-problem Internet gamblers. It is likely that the profile of those at risk for developing Internet gambling problems will change as this mode of gambling becomes more accepted and widely used and further research is conducted.</p>\n<h4>Physical and Mental Health Comorbidities</h4>\n<p>Studies have also found higher rates of health and mental health comorbidities, including smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as substance abuse or dependence, and mood disorders among Internet as compared to non-Internet gamblers</p>\n<p>. One study found that Internet gambling frequency was significantly associated with poor physical and mental health, after controlling for demographics and pathological gambling, but overall gambling frequency was not. A study examining irrational and erroneous thinking found that greater levels of erroneous cognitions significantly predicted problem gambling severity when controlling for other variables among Internet gamblers. As psychological comorbidities and irrational thinking are related to problems amongst land-based gamblers, these results suggest that the clinical characteristics of Internet problem gamblers are similar to offline gamblers.</p>\n<p>There is also evidence that Internet problem gamblers have higher rates of drug and alcohol use than non-problem gamblers. Analysis of 1119 surveys completed by online gamblers indicated that compared to non-problem gamblers, problem gamblers were more likely to smoke cigarettes, have a disability and drink alcohol while gambling online. This is consistent with higher rates of mood and substance use disorders and self-harm among highly involved Internet gamblers. An Australian telephone survey found that illicit drug use was a significant predictor of having greater levels of gambling problems. These results may indicate that Internet gamblers who are at risk for gambling problems may engage in a range of risk-taking behaviours, for example, due to high levels of impulsivity.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the relationships between Internet gambling, gambling problems and other mental health issues are still unclear. For example, multiple studies in Sweden did not support the assumption that Internet gambling would attract people with low social support, psychological problems, physical problems or health problems such as risky alcohol consumption. Similarly, offline gamblers were more likely to report health and psychological impacts of problem gambling than Internet gamblers in an Australian study comparing at-risk and problem gamblers. Furthermore, in a nationally representative Australian telephone survey, Internet gamblers were less likely to drink alcohol and smoke when they were gambling online than when gambling in land-based venues, indicating they were unlikely to be using Internet modes to avoid restrictions on smoking or alcohol.</p>\n<p>Overall, existing studies fail to define specific personal or behavioural risk factors to differentiate between Internet and non-Internet problem gamblers. There is some evidence that these do represent at least partially different cohorts; however, the heterogeneity in each group makes specific risk factors difficult to identify. No studies have established the causation between associations found and the direction of any link between problem online gambling. The individual factors related to Internet gambling problems are under-researched and would benefit from longitudinal studies to clarify the mechanism of action of any relationships between variables.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Gambling Behaviours</h3>\n<p>Intense gambling involvement has been verified as a predictor of gambling problems for online and offline gamblers. Other gambling-related behaviours have also been identified as being potential markers of risky Internet gambling. Gambling online on unregulated sites and using multiple different accounts and different online activities have been found to be predictive of higher levels of gambling problems. It is possible that unregulated sites attract individuals who are at greater risk for experiencing problems, and use of multiple online accounts and multiple activities is a proxy indicator of gambling involvement, a known predictor of harm.</p>\n<p>Analyses of player accounts, including players who exhibit what appears to be risky behaviour, as well as those who have closed accounts due to stated gambling problems, have enabled markers of problem gambling, including early predictors, to be identified. Potential predictors of risky Internet gambling or the emergence of problems include engaging in multiple online gambling activities, high variability in betting, multiple bets per day, many active betting days per month, many bets per betting day, high overall stakes and net loss, increasing bet size and losses, chasing losses and intervals of increasing wagering size, followed by rapid drops. One notable finding from studies of the <em><em>bwin.party</em></em> dataset (which include most of the behavioural analyses that have been conducted) is the consistent finding that participation in live action sports betting (also known as in-play) is an independent predictor of problem gambling severity, when controlling for gambling involvement. This type of betting allows frequent and repeated bets to be placed during a single sporting event, with rapidly determined outcomes, which may be particularly attractive to people who are highly impulsive and at greater risk for disordered gambling. However, this relationship has not been investigated in independent samples.</p>\n<p>In addition to behavioural variables, other information about gamblers&rsquo; risk levels can be observed by online operators. Analysis of customer communication with online operators identified risk markers that predicted customers closing their accounts due to stated gambling problems. These included expressed doubts about results of games, requests for account reopening, queries about financial transactions and account administration, the frequency of contacts per month (urgency) and use of a threatening tonality. These results were based on a relatively small sample with a limited control group. A subsequent study found that automated text analyses of email correspondence aided by human assessment could identify anger (abusive tonality) as well as urgency (time-related words) and a lower use of justification for demands and/or actions, which were found to predict self-exclusion.</p>\n<p>Single, unmistakable indicators for problems are uncommon, and therefore detection of risk indicators usually relies on algorithms to detect interaction between these. Further research is still required to untangle whether game-specific characteristics play a causal role in the emergence of gambling problems. Research is also needed on a variety of different player accounts, as the vast majority of research has been done with a single dataset from one European gambling site, which may not be generalizable to other online gamblers. Identifying, detecting and acting on early risk indicators may reduce gambling-related harms sustained by Internet gamblers. However, few online operators have shared their data to be used for research purposes or implemented policies and strategies to detect potentially risky players and implement appropriate resources. Such preventative action is generally not required by Internet gambling regulators, meaning that further action is reliant on operator-initiated action.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Taken together, the evidence reviewed here suggests that Internet gambling does not cause gambling problems in, and of, itself. However, use of Internet gambling is more common among highly involved gamblers, and for some Internet gamblers, this medium appears to significantly contribute to gambling problems. Internet gamblers are a heterogeneous group, and the impact of this mode of access on gambling problems is moderated by a range of individual, social and environmental variables. As Internet gambling continues to evolve and participation increases, particularly among young people who are highly familiar with Internet technology and online commerce, it is likely that related problems will emerge. Research and regulation will have to evolve to further the understanding of the impact of this mode of access on the experience and incidence of gambling disorders.</p>\n<p>There appear to be some unique differences between Internet and land-based gamblers who experience problems. Theoretical models for gambling and problem gambling have been developed based on land-based gambling, largely not considering the recent emergence of Internet modes. It is important to revisit these conceptual models to verify if they account for pathological gambling among Internet gamblers and whether any new variables or interactions should be included to explain the emergence of gambling problems. Research will likely continue to distinguish the characteristics (mediators and moderator) that may be used to identify online gamblers who are at risk for gambling-related problems. This is necessary to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how people develop gambling problems.</p>\n<p>Research is needed to understand how to reduce the likelihood of people transitioning to disordered gambling. The Internet offers a potentially strong environment for the provision of responsible gambling, including player-focused tools and resources for moderating play such as expenditure tracking, self-set spend limits, time outs and information. Furthermore, operators can enact strategies to assist customers including targeted notifications (e.g. pop-up messages) based on patterns of play and other tailored contacts derived from analysis of player accounts to identify risky behaviour. Enhancing the provision of a responsible gambling environment will require cooperation between independent researchers to design, evaluate and verify strategies, operators to enable access to appropriate data and implement procedures and regulators to require the use of effective responsible gambling policies. Treatment and prevention strategies must be revisited to ensure that these are relevant and effective for Internet gamblers. Brief online interventions as well as in-depth online treatment programmes may be relevant for Internet gamblers. Online self-exclusion programmes should be developed that would allow individuals to exclude themselves from multiple gambling sites simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The findings presented here are important for policy makers due to evidence that Internet gambling in itself is not harmful. The research is also relevant for clinicians, as it suggests that in addition to some gambling forms being more likely to lead to problems, how individuals access these also has an impact on subsequent harms. This highlights the importance of considering the broad spectrum of gambling behaviour and how different patterns of gambling may be associated with the experience of gambling-related harm. Further research is required to identify the protective factors of online gambling environments that may reduce levels of harms among Internet gamblers. These may include the capacity for lower bet sizes than in land-based venues (due to lower costs for operators); the ability to track wins, losses and deposits using an online account, gambling only for short sessions due to other activities concurrently occurring in the home, or outside of a gambling venue; the presence of others when gambling; and access to responsible gambling tools and resources.</p>\n</div>\n"
